## About ##
This program pulls data from OpenStreetMap using the Overpass Turbo API. Pulled data is converted to Points of Interest (POI) or Waypoints in a KML format that Oruxmaps / OrganicMaps preferers. 

## Details for usage ##

Read the included documentation: readme-licence.pdf


## Known limitations ##

18.02.2024: Beside all your configuration, by now the Organic.Maps icons are shown as a red pins only. Will be changed in my coding season 2024/2025. Now spring / summer starts and my life has different priorities.


## Data privacy ##
- By design XML structures as GPX and KML reach out for external servers. For example, interpreting the Garmin GPX, you will find certain html addresses in the GPX's header that support interpreting the structure.
- Using icons make the KML interpreter (as Oruxmaps) reaching out to my server via [http://motorradtouren.de/pics](http://motorradtouren.de/pics)
 No access data is collected or stored for this service by this program or on the server motorradtouren.de.
